## Hi. I'm João. ✨

Whenever I'm not **making music**, **playing guitar**, **sound designing** or **repairing cracked cold solder joints from old electronics**, I'm most likely **fixing/modding my** *(barely functioning)* **car**... to various degrees of success.

I'm passionate about **microcontrollers**, **embedded systems** and **digital electronics**, with most of my **professional experience** being in **robotic systems design** and **prototyping**. I've also had a fling with the **rail industry** building **control units** for **vehicles** and **tracks**. *I did also sign an NDA which prevents me from yapping too much about it*. Boo.

**Fancy stalking me?** Head on over to [my music blog](https://joaogusmao.music.blog/), in which you'll find semi-coherent ramblings on music and audio.
